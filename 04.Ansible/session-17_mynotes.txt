Next 2 days my voice will be slow:

We today discuss on functions/filters:

Ansible we cannot create functions, we can use existing filters

Filter is data manipulation/transaformation
Eg: devops --> DevOps
aws --> AWS

13-conditions.yaml
------------------
if a number is less than 10, print less than 10
otherwise print greater than equal to 10.

number < 10

prompts are always considered as string even if we pass number, shell can take it but not in ansible..

Ansible is strict, it cannot automatically convert text into number.

10 --> text

ansible filters --> google search

ansible filters are useful, they are developed in python

ansible convert string to int --> google search
when: number < 10
when: number | int < 10
so if u pass string it takes as zero

14-filters.yaml
----------------
filter is denoted by | pipe symbol

dictionary is map/key-value pair
dict2items/list
----------------

maps starts with {}
list starts with [] inside it can have maps again and list of addresses again

items to dictionary now:
-------------------------
items2dict

like this we have many filters, can use upon need.

ansible loops --> google search
-------------
install package using loops

ansible-playbook 16-loops.yaml

Now, lets create expense project in ansible..
-------------------------------------------------

ansible mysql module --> google search
mysql_info module
its a community module, not created by ansible but by ppl like us created and ansible considered that.

just as we check in putty that ansible --version if not installed will throw error same way...
db.yaml version check is using mysql_info module

when u run a command and to take that output into a variable we should be using register: variable_name

we are facing an error: Missing python dependencies

Ansible is developed in Pythin.
PyMySQL is a dependency for python to connect mysql servers
cryptography to be installed to use password in command-line.

npm install --> to install dependencies for nodejs
pip if for python
ansible pip --> google search

ansible --version u can check its using python 3.9
hence pip we use 3.9 if its 3.11 then same 3.11 we use.

mysql -h db.daws78s.online -u root -pExpenseApp@1
for me:
mysql -h 54.226.176.22 -uroot -pExpenseApp@1 went successful:


practice:
filters,
loops
db.yaml

we finished:
variables,
datatypes
functions
loops
conditions
