we will check
next week few more shell scripting concepts.
ansible terraform python same concepts will repeat, we cant say linux is base for them but same concepts..

Lets do expense-shell project and complete today...

mysql.sh --> DB
----------------
whenever u create servers go immediately and update Route53 records..
upcoming sessions we do it automatically using terraform.

db.mydevops-learning.cloud
backend.mydevops-learning.cloud
frontend.mydevops-learning.cloud

mysql_secure_installation --set-root-pass ExpenseApp@1
we ran this last step and showed error upon 2nd run since password was set in first run of script...
there is something called idempotency...

Idempotency
------------
nature of program irrespective of how many times u run, it shud not change result.
shell-script is not idempotent in nature by default, we need to take care..

mysql_secure_installation --set-root-pass ExpenseApp@1
first run success
mysql_secure_installation --set-root-pass ExpenseApp@1
2nd run showed as failure...check in cmd

correct pwd ichinappudu or pwd already set inappudu exit code is 0
mysql -h localhost -uroot -pExpenseApp@1 -s 'SHOW DATABSES;'
mysql -h localhost -uroot -pExpenseApp@1 -s 'show databases;'
error
mysql -h db.mydevops-learning.cloud -uroot -pExpenseApp@1 -s 'show databases;'
echo $?

Toggle line comment last 2 lines of code in mysql.sh

mysql -h db.mydevops-learning.cloud -uroot -pExpenseApp@1 -s 'show databases;'
for check u can give any command but this is basic command in mysql
so we first check 1st run and if not installed it will run and if already run will skip it..

idempotent, normal intw may not ask but little innovative way who interviews may ask...

in project u shud defintely check for this, coz we dont know how many ppl run this...

u must enter same password otherwise backend nodejs will fail..

backend.sh
----------
useradd expense --> this partcular command is not idempotent..
eg: even in facebook after signup with one email id u cant signup with same email id again, it does validation. same way here...

testing in cmd line:
id ec2-user
echo $? -->0
id expense -->after running the script
echo $? -->0
id sivakumar
no such user
echo $? -->1

in code:
useradd expense --> remove this line and check id expense and its status code means u first check if this exists or not..
id expense &>>$LOGFILE
if [ $? -ne 0 ]
then
	useradd expense &>>$LOGFILE
	echo "failure does not exist" --> u can use VALIDATE here VALIDATE $? "Creating expense user.."
else	
	echo "it exists"
fi

mkdir /app
again means fails... so this cmd is also not idempotent
so we use
mkdir -p /app --> dont need bigger validations, if exists skips otherwise creates..

backend.service creation
vim is used only for humans, so we create a file...
take the absolute path and copy to systemd inside script

after running script u check:
netstat -lntp
systemctl status backend

2nd run:
after downloading backend its stuck, lets check why
sudo su
cd /app
unzip /tmp/backend.zip
replace DBCOnfig.js? yes, no, all
so this we need to take care
cd /app
rm -rf /app/*
unzip /tmp/backend.zip

now schema we r doing multiple times right, so is there a chance for duplicate?
open and see sudo cat /app/schema/backend.sql
these cmds are all idempotent we gave like that..

frontend.sh
------------
u create expense.conf file here similar to backend.service

zipfile download is not a problem if multiple times, only extraction has issue:
sudo su
curl ....
hit multiple times, it shows files in cmd line..

run the script:
netstat -lntp
hit the website mydevops-learning.cloud

Troubleshooting steps when problem occurs in application:
---------------------------------------------------------
is frontend able to connect to backend
if not check inside expense.conf the backend.mydevops-learning.cloud
check backend.mydevops-learning.cloud ip in Route53
if all good then check security groups
check now backend to db connection
telnet check to backend : telnet backendip 8080
backend lo ekkada db connections ichi unnam
schema check
backend.service 
systemctl
port open unda leda
telnet connect work avuthunda leda: telnet mysql 3306
entering string is causing issues - so enter numbers only in amount
else u need to start backend service..

----------------------------------------
51.09 - Quiz time

u can fill form with all details so that we approach u for job assistance...

1. ssh -i custom_key --> how do u specify a custom SSH key file when connecting to a server

2. $? --> special variable that represents the exit code status of last executed command

3. Special variable $$ represents: PID of the script

4. command >>file : how can u append the output of a command to an existing file in shell

5. for loop is used for iterating over a range of numbers in Bash

6. && operator purpose is and condition, | is for or

7. proper variable declaration: A=10 (without space)

8. How to execute command and take output in shell.
result=$(command)
result=$(command) --> is not right

9. 1>>$LOGFILE --> represents success output

10. passing cmdn line args to a shell script --> script-name arg1 arg2 ... argn

11. shell script is not idempotent by nature

12. how to read input from user in shell script -> read command

13. $! --> special variable to store output of last process id

14. $0 --> is for printing name of shell

15. 31 represents red color
