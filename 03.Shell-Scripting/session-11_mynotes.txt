Session10_week3:
---------------

shebang is the location of shell interpreter, it will read the command and execute the commands...

datatypes are not that imp, it will detect by itself as number or string.

variables
data types
conditions
functions - we will discuss from here today
loops

functions
---------
it is a block of code that can do some work. It accepts inputs too..

FUNC_NAME () {

}

Variable - any value repeated inside code can be declared as a variable. delaring variables even if its occurrance is just once is a best practice...

similarly, if a block of code is repeating, consider using functions.

log:
----
its a best practice to store logs in case of both success/failures.

Redirections:
-------------
> --> by default only success output is redirected
1 --> success eg: ls -l 1> output.log it saves, ajakaj 1> output.log wont save
2 --> failure eg: ls -l 2> output.log wont save, aajaj 2> output.log saves
& --> means both success and failure
>> --> appends
there shud be no space btw &>>
&>>
eg: ls -l &>> output.log
    ajjdhdj &>> output.log
    now cat output.log u will see both above output...

LOGFILE=/tmp/$FILENAME-$DATE.log
btw filename and date it must be hyphen only, underscore did not print filename

31min colors explanation:
--------------------------
user can immediately spot it with colors for Success anf Failure
colors in shell script..

syntax:
-------
\e[31m --> red color
eg: echo -e "\e[31m Hello \e[32m World"

31 Red
32 Green
33 Yellow
34 Blue
35 Purple
0 white

If I gave 20 packages to run what will u do? is it simple/good to write 20 lines in script? in such case we use loops...

loops
-----
for(int i=0; i<20; i++){
	print $i;
}

for loop shell script google search

linux simple packages to install - google search
since we are using t2.micro picking small packages
mysql
gcc
chrony
fail2ban
postgis2_94

steps
-----
log redirection
colors are mandatory

1. user have root access or not
2. send packages to install as parameters (I dont know what packages to install, do will send dynamically)
sudo sh install-packages 
3. then list the packages inside loop
4. if package is already installed, no need to resinstall right
yum list installed mysql
echo $? -->results 0 means already installed
yum list installed docker means not installed
echo $? -->results 1
dnf list installed

59.10mins

we using else for user experience...
shell script disadvantage --> automatic ga exit avvadu..

Q&A:
-----
sourcing : we can put block of code in other script and call this in other scripts. that is usually used in object oriented programming languages but in scripting we use a single script itself.

how to redirect access log to one file and error log to another file... google search
2> error 1> output

int i = 10 if numbers
for characters we dont we need to declare that way..

--------------------------
expense-shell 1.19hr
--------------------------
mysql.sh
sometimes t2.micro may not be successful that time take t3.medium

main project also its same concept with more services...we dont discuss again shell scripting.

after executing output:
netstat -lntp
lets stop here today:
everything is scripting next ansible, terraform u must practice..

Q&A 1.26hr
-----------

using shell scrip wanted to automate smthg, variable declare chesi pwd set chesanu.
password is in secret manager in my project I delared in shell script
u need to keep inside OS somewhere or inside valut and get that dynamically
team forge - we use
team forge software --> google search.
this is configuration management like ansible..
u need to use AWS Command Line and get it dynamically..

dnf install $i -y &>>$LOGFILE here &>>$LOGILE is not a command we are storing only. dnf .... is the only command..

these colors work in linux script but when we call this in other tools then do colors appear? we use ansible it automatically takes colors..

praveen facing issue with project in backend, status is always coming as failed.
problem will be with authentication or schema loading... just check logs

mini project why cant we do with container
shell ansible terraform cicd-jenkins dockers k8s maybe 2m then u can apply for jobs...
